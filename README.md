## About
Hello, my name is Sietoyo, but you can call me Toyo. I have a background in Economics and History and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Information Management. My journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in the social sciences and ignited a passion for using data to derive meaningful insights.

I have extensive experience working in the humanitarian sector, where I see data as lives rather than mere numbers. Throughout my career, I have made notable contributions that have positively impacted lives. I am always on the lookout for innovative approaches to my work and I am committed to continuous learning and development.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and exploring new destinations through travel. I am excited to bring my analytical and problem-solving skills to the field of data science, merging my social sciences background with my love for data to make a difference.

This repository serves as a platform to display my projects and monitor my advancement in Data Science and Analytics-related subjects.
